# Robot-Guider-Navigation-Project
This project features an assembly-coded navigation system developed for an EEBot robot, designed to navigate through an obstacle maze with an 85% success rate in trials. The system integrates several subsystems written in assembly code to fine-tune and synchronize photodetectors, motors, speed control, and bumper sensors, ensuring seamless coordination with the robot's navigation routine. Through extensive troubleshooting and hardware optimization, this project showcases the application of low-level programming and hardware interfacing in building a reliable and efficient robotic system.
